// leetcode -> https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/

// Given an integer array nums, sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) and a target value k. The array is rotated at some pivot point that is unknown. Find the index at which k is present and if k is not present return -1.


// Examples:
// Input : nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], k = 0

// Output: 4

// Explanation: Here, the target is 0. We can see that 0 is present in the given rotated sorted array, nums. Thus, we get output as 4, which is the index at which 0 is present in the array.

// Input: nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2], k = 3

// Output: -1

// Explanation: Here, the target is 3. Since 3 is not present in the given rotated sorted array. Thus, we get the output as -1.
